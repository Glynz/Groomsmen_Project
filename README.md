## Thank You
First off, I have to say a big thank you to you guys. Desite us not having known each other for very long in the grand scheme of things, I can say for certain that I was honored to have you stand with me up there on the aisle. It was a daunting day to say the least, but I couldn't ask for a better group of guys to be by my side. With the mushy stuff out of the way, lets get to the technical stuff.

## Base Configuration
This device is the Raspberry PI 3+ which includes a higher base clock at ~1.4 GHz and 1GB of RAM making it a suitable platform for a variety of tasks. Although the device could be used as another basic computer in your life, this device, in my personally opnion, can be best utilized as a basic home server serving a variety of services across the network. As such, this raspberry pi has been configured as such. It runs using the [Raspbian Stretch Lite package](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/) which is a minimal headless version to keep the overhead low. With everything said, feel free to change this as it suits your needs.
