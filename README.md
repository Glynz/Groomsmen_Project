## Thank You
First off, I have to say a big thank you to you guys. Desite us not having known each other for very long in the grand scheme of things, I can say for certain that I was honored to have you stand with me up there on the aisle. It was a daunting day to say the least, but I couldn't ask for a better group of guys to be by my side. With the mushy stuff out of the way, lets get to the technical stuff.
